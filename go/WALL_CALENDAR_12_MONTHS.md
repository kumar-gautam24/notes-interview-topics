## EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS

### If Behind Schedule:
```
DON'T PANIC. ADJUST.

Check:
  [ ] Health okay? (supplements, sleep, exercise)
  [ ] Time management? (are you using 2 hrs?)
  [ ] Focus? (or jumping around?)
  [ ] Roadmap realistic? (maybe too ambitious)

Action:
  1. Identify bottleneck
  2. Adjust timeline (add 1-2 months)
  3. Don't quit
  4. Keep going
```

### If Want to Quit:
```
READ THIS:

You've come _____ days (_____ %)
You've invested _____ hours
You've built _____ projects

Quitting now = All of that wasted

Bad day ≠ Bad journey
Bad week ≠ Failed mission

Rules:
  1. Never quit on a bad day
  2. Take 1 rest day
  3. Come back Day +2
  4. Read your "Why" (Notebook Page 1)
  5. Call accountability partner
```

### Accountability Partner:
```
Name: _____________________
Phone: _____________________
Commitment: Check in every Sunday

If you miss 2 days → They call you
If you want to quit → They talk you down
```
