## Emergency Reset Button: When All Else Fails

When you're completely stuck, overwhelmed, or blank, use this emergency reset protocol:

1. **Take a Deep Breath**
   Inhale for 4 counts, hold for 2, exhale for 6.

2. **Reset Statement**
   ```
   "I'd like to take a step back and make sure I'm approaching this effectively."
   "Let me restart with a clearer structure."
   ```

3. **Start With Absolute Basics**
   ```
   "At its core, this problem is asking us to..."
   "The fundamental operation we need to perform is..."
   ```

4. **Use a Familiar Framework**
   Fall back on a problem-solving framework you're comfortable with:
   - Input → Process → Output
   - Brute Force → Optimize → Implement
   - Understand → Plan → Execute → Verify

5. **Ask Direct Question**
   ```
   "Would it be helpful if I started with a simpler version of this problem?"
   "Could you point me to which aspect of the problem I should focus on first?"
   ```

### Key Mindset
Even experienced engineers get stuck. The ability to reset, reorient, and restart demonstrates resilience and problem-solving maturity.

---

## Final Reminder

Remember that the interview is assessing:
- How you think
- How you communicate
- How you handle challenges
- How you collaborate

The specific solution matters less than demonstrating these qualities throughout the process. Stay calm, be methodical, and show your best problem-solving self.

Good luck!
