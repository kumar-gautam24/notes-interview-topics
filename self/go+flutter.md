2. Secondary: "Go by Example" (gobyexample.com)
3. Book: "The Go Programming Language" by Donovan & Kernighan (download/buy)
4. YouTube: "Traversy Media - Go Crash Course" (watch once only)

**For DSA:**
1. Primary: "NeetCode.io" (structured 150 problems)
2. Secondary: LeetCode (daily problem)
3. Book: "Cracking the Coding Interview" (read 1 chapter/week)
4. YouTube: "NeetCode" (only when completely stuck)

**For System Design:**
1. Primary: "System Design Primer" (GitHub repo)
2. Book: "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Martin Kleppner
3. YouTube: "Gaurav Sen" playlist (watch later, Month 6+)

**For Backend Concepts:**
1. "Web Scalability for Startup Engineers" (book)
2. "Hussein Nasser" YouTube channel (networking, databases)

**Download/bookmark ALL resources today. Never search for resources again.**

**Evening (2 hours):**

Create a "Learning Contract" with yourself:
```
I, [Your Name], commit to:

1. Study minimum 4 hours/day, 6 days/week (Sundays off)
2. Code minimum 2 hours/day
3. Solve 1 DSA problem/day (even Sundays)
4. Commit to GitHub every day (green squares)
5. No new tutorials/courses until current one is 100% done
6. No switching technologies for 12 months
7. No excuses. If sick, do 1 hour. If traveling, do 30 min.

If I break this contract, I will:
- [Choose a penalty: Donate ₹500 to charity]
- [Restart the week from Day 1]

Signed: _____________
Date: _____________
Witness (friend/family): _____________
```

Sign it. Get someone to witness it. Take photo. Print it. Put it on wall.

07:00 - 08:00   Review Anki cards + Previous day's notes
08:00 - 08:30   Plan today (read tomorrow's tasks)
08:30 - 10:00   Deep Work Block 1: Main learning (Go/DSA)
10:00 - 10:15   Break (walk, stretch, water)
10:15 - 12:00   Deep Work Block 2: Coding/Building
12:00 - 13:00   Lunch + Rest
13:00 - 17:00   Day job (Flutter work)
17:00 - 17:30   Evening walk/exercise
17:30 - 19:00   Deep Work Block 3: Project work
19:00 - 19:30   Dinner
19:30 - 21:00   Deep Work Block 4: DSA problem + Review
21:00 - 21:30   Daily log (Notion), commit to GitHub
21:30 - 22:00   Light reading/unwinding
22:00           Sleep

Total learning: 6 hours/day
```

**Sunday Schedule:**
```
Flexible, but:
- Morning: 1 DSA problem
- Afternoon: Review week's notes
- Evening: Plan next week
- No deep learning (rest)
```

**Evening (2 hours):**

**Prepare accountability system:**

1. **Find an accountability partner:**
   - Post in Flutter India communities
   - Post in /r/FlutterDev, /r/golang
   - Message: "Looking for accountability partner for 12-month backend learning journey"
   - Exchange daily progress reports

2. **Set up automated tracking:**
   - GitHub: Commit streak
   - LeetCode: Calendar streak
   - Notion: Daily log streak

3. **Create emergency protocol:**
   - "If I miss 1 day: Do double work next day"
   - "If I miss 2 days: Restart current week"
   - "If I miss 3 days: Review entire roadmap, adjust"

#### Day -2: The Mental Preparation

**Morning (3 hours):**

**Understanding the Psychology:**

Read and internalize these concepts:

**1. The Dip (by Seth Godin concept):**
- Every skill has a "dip" - the period where it's hard and progress is slow
- Week 2-4 will be the hardest (novelty wears off, progress slows)
- Week 6-8 will be second hardest (concepts get complex)
- Most people quit in the dip. You won't.

**2. The Compound Effect:**
- 1% improvement daily = 37x better in a year
- You won't feel progress daily, but monthly progress will shock you

**3. The Two-Minute Rule:**
- On days you don't want to study: "Just do 2 minutes"
- 2 minutes turns into 20 minutes 80% of the time
- Showing up is 80% of success

**4. The Identity Shift:**
- Stop saying: "I'm a Flutter developer learning Go"
- Start saying: "I'm a software engineer who builds full-stack mobile systems"
- Your identity shapes your actions

**Create Affirmations (say daily, morning):**
```
1. "I complete what I start."
2. "I am becoming a great engineer."
3. "Discomfort is growth."
4. "I learn from every mistake."
5. "I am building my future."
