🚀 Current project:
DevLog - A productivity tracker for developers
(CLI + REST API + Dashboard, built with Go + PostgreSQL)
Live: devlog.railway.app

💡 What drives me:
I started with mobile development but realized I needed to understand 
the full stack. So I'm learning Go and building backend systems. 
The challenge of designing scalable APIs gets me excited.

📚 Learning:
- Advanced Go patterns
- PostgreSQL optimization
- System design fundamentals
- DSA (50+ problems solved)

🤝 Let's connect:
Always happy to discuss Go, Flutter, or side projects!
GitHub: github.com/yourusername
```

```
Daily (15 min before sleep):
- Write 1 short LinkedIn post
- Share what you learned today
- Include code snippet
- 3-4 posts per week minimum
```

**Example Posts:**
```
Post 1:
"Just learned Go's defer statement. Mind = blown! 🤯

It guarantees cleanup code runs even if function panics.
No more forgetting to close files!

#golang #learning #programming"

Post 2:
"Built my first REST API in Go today! 🎉

5 endpoints, PostgreSQL database, proper error handling.
Coming from Flutter, understanding the backend side is eye-opening.

Next: Deploy to production!

#golang #backend #webdev"

Post 3:
"TIL: Go's goroutines are way simpler than threads in other languages.

This code runs 1000 concurrent tasks:

# EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS

## If You Miss a Day:
```
1. Don't panic
2. Don't try to "catch up" by doubling next day
3. Just do today's work
4. Note in journal: Why did I miss? How to prevent?
5. Get back on track immediately
```

## If You Want to Quit (You Will Feel This):
```
Expected times:
- Week 3: Novelty wears off
- Week 8: Progress feels slow
- Week 16: Plateau phase
- Week 25: Interview rejections hurt

When you feel this:
1. Read your Day 1 notebook entry
2. Review your progress (you've come far!)
3. Talk to accountability partner
4. Take 1 rest day (not 3!)
5. Remember: Quitting guarantees failure. Continuing gives you a chance.
```

## If You Get Rejected:
```
Normal. Expected. Part of the process.

After rejection:
1. Ask for feedback (they probably won't give, but try)
2. Identify what went wrong
3. Improve that specific area
4. Apply to 5 more companies
5. Keep going

50 applications = 5 interviews = 1 offer (industry average)
```

## If You Get Sick:
```
Minimum mode:
- Take your supplements
- Do 1 DSA problem (15 min)
- Commit to GitHub (keeps streak)
- Rest

Don't try to study 2 hours when sick.
Better to do 15 min than 0 min.
```

✅ Specific (day-by-day detail)
✅ Measurable (clear milestones)
✅ Achievable (2 hours/day is doable)
✅ Time-bound (12 months)

Your success depends on:
1. Health (fix B12/D3 first)
2. Consistency (daily shows up)
3. No jumping (finish what you start)
4. Patience (12 months is long but worth it)

One year from now, you'll either be:

The roadmap is ready.
The calendar is clear.
The choice is yours.
